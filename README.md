# OTT-Content-Analysis
<br>
I am excited to share that I participated in the Elevate Hackathon conducted by IEEE CS chapter GHRCE and successfully implemented an OTT content analysis using Power BI. The dataset provided to me was the Amazon Prime dataset, and I am able to analyze it using Power BI to gain insights into the content available on the platform.
